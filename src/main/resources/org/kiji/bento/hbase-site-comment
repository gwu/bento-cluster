the behavior of your HBase cluster. Outright removing one of the variables
defined here may cause errors in the clusters started by bento-cluster.

Note that bento-cluster forces the values of some configuration variables.
Namely, hbase.master.port and hbase.regionserver.port are controlled by
bento-cluster and any values specified here will be ignored.
